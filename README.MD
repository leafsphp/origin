# Origin: Minimal Leaf Starter Kit

A minimal starter kit for Leaf PHP, inspired by Laravel Breeze. This kit provides essential scaffolding for authentication, built with **Blade**, **Bootstrap**, and yes... **jQuery**. ðŸ˜‰

## What comes in origin

#### Authentication

Origin provides a secure and flexible authentication system, enabling users to register, log in, and log out with ease. It includes:

- **Session Management**: Keeps users logged in with robust session handling, ensuring security and user experience.
- **2FA Verification**: Adds an extra layer of protection by allowing users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for their accounts, offering both SMS and app-based token options.
- **Sign-in Mail Alerts**: Notifies users of any login attempts or new sign-ins, helping them monitor account activity in real-time.
- **OAuth Login with Google**: Simplifies sign-in with the option to authenticate using Google, speeding up the process for users who prefer single sign-on (SSO).

#### Well-Designed UI/UX

The app features a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. The intuitive user interface (UI) ensures that users can navigate the app easily, while the optimized user experience (UX) patterns reduce friction and make it easy to access key features.

#### Mailing Templates

Ready-to-use email templates for common transactional emails like password resets, account confirmation, and notifications. These templates are designed to be customizable and professional, keeping consistent with the appâ€™s branding.

## Why Origin?

Origin is perfect for developers who want a quick start with Leaf PHP without all the overhead. It's lightweight, simple and minimal, allowing you to focus on building your app while providing a basic structure for common web application features.
